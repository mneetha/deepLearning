Why Deep Learning?
ML algorithms by nature stop improving after certain point even when provided with more data over time. They tend to plateau on performance / accuracy. Whereas in the same scenario if a deep learning neural network is provided more data, over time it learns more dimensions and hence starts giving us better accuracy.


What is Deep Learning?
DL is a subset of ML algorithms. In ML algorithms, everything is flattened in a single dimension array; whereas in DL we use something called tensors. Tensors are small matrices inside a bigger matrix. Simplest DL algorithm is basically a perceptron. Perceptron allows us to build a binary classification. It accepts multiple inputs in the form of a matrix and then based on the probability distribution value we can know which class they belong to.
The inputs to the perceptron are matrices, say x1, x2, x3, x4 of same size and each matrix is assigned a weight. This weight represents what share of this value is contributing to the output. A perceptron is an algorithm used for supervised learning of binary classifiers. Binary classifiers decide whether an input usually represented by a series of vectors, belongs to a specific class; it is a single layer neural network.
When we combine multiple perceptrons, we get Dense layer. It becomes a feed forward artificial neural network.
A single layer perceptron is a logistic regression function dealing with single dimension.
With MLP (multiple layer perceptron) have multiple dense layer. With each layer, we can extract multiple features based on the inputs enhancing the accuracy as we go through more layers.
